# EventStreamer

## Requirements

1.	Two modes; 1) viewing of an image stream and 2) posting of images to the stream.
2.	Viewing of images uploaded ordered sorted by timestamp.  Viewing could be more or less fancy, starting with just a simple list view ordered from newest to oldest.  List should update every x seconds.  The list will also show the username of the person posting for each image.
3.	Posting of images directly from camera or from existing images stored in phone to the public stream.
4.	When capturing and posting images the user would have to specify the event she is capturing for.  This could potentially be done automatically based on geo location info.
 
Weâ€™ll need a server side service to keep track of the events people are posting images for and for the images themselves.
